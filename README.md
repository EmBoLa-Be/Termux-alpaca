# Termux-alpaca
This is a simple shell script to install the alpaca llama 7B model on termux for Android phones. 
All credits goes to the original developers of alpaca.cpp and the ggml-model-q4_1.bin model. 

there are two files:
* install-alpaca-Android.sh this one uses the default huggingface.co website to download the model

* install-alpaca-mega.sh this one uses mega to download the model(faster but with limited downloads)
